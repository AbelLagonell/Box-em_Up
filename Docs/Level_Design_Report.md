After trying to design the levels I noticed that one thing that could be added to the game is a movement mechanic. Something like a big jump, a roll, or a dash that the player can use to get out of trouble if they are surrounded or they need to cross a gap. This came from the addition of pitfalls to the level design, to add both a place where enemies could be dispatched more easily and as a psuedo divider that can lead the enemies clump on one side if ever they become too much. Another feature I might want to add is another ability something like a aoe on the player so that when they are in those situations they have options if they picked up the ability before hand. Another ability that might need to be added is one that would happen either during or after using the movement mechanic.
